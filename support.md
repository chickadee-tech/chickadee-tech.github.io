## Email Support
Emailing [support@chickadee.tech](mailto:support@chickadee.tech) is the best way to get support for your Chickadee Tech products. We hope to respond within 24 hours of an email during the week and will likely be faster during working hours on the west coast of the United States. Weekends we may be away from our keyboards so please be patient until we can get back on Monday. Try the forum links below for help from the community.

## Forums
We have a few threads in various RC forums where you can find help from us and other Chickadee Tech customers. Here are a few links:

  * [RCGroups](http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2706156)
