Feed your Polystack with up to two amps with this Pololu voltage regulator cradle. The pin headers match the pinout of both the <a href="https://www.pololu.com/product/2831">1A</a> and <a href="https://www.pololu.com/product/2858">2.5A</a> Pololu regulators to simplify mounting them. Don't have a Pololu regulator? Use your current regulator by feeding 5V, GND and battery pins directly instead.

The offset regulator design minimizes the height impact on the Polystack as a whole to just 3.1 total mm (1.5mm stacking height + 1.6mm board thickness). <em>However</em>, this means it may run into other things outside of the normal footprint. So, make sure you have the room!
