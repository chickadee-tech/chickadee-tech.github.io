The microSD mod is the best example of what makes Polystack awesome. It leverages an SPI connection directly from the microcontroller. Betaflight and Raceflight can then log 1:1 at very low looptimes. External OpenLog based blackboxes are limited by the serial speed. This isn't.

Unlike other flight controllers that support SPI based blackboxes, this one is not bundled with it. So, buy it if or when you want. If you want something else, then that SPI connection is still there for some other awesome mod.
